## Phase 1C: Order Management & Fill Tracking [1.5 days]

### Component: Order State Management
**Goal**: Track pending orders and detect fills

#### What to Build:
- `OrderManager` class to store pending orders in memory
- Fill detection by polling `/v1/fills` endpoint
- Position tracking with buy/sell reconciliation

#### Implementation Steps:
1. Create OrderManager with in-memory order storage
2. Implement fill polling every 5 seconds
3. Add position calculation (net shares owned)
4. Create order status display

#### Success Criteria:
- Track all pending orders until filled or cancelled
- Detect fills within 10 seconds of execution
- Maintain accurate position count for ðŸ¦„

**Dependencies**: Phase 1B order placement  
**Effort**: 12 hours  
**Risk**: Medium - state management complexity

## Key Design Decisions

### âœ… **Simplification Choices**
- **Single Stock**: Only ðŸ¦„ until everything works perfectly
- **Fixed Parameters**: $1000 orders, 5-minute intervals, no configuration
- **Memory Storage**: No database - all state in memory during runtime
- **Conservative Rate Limit**: 40 req/sec (80% of limit) for safety buffer

### ðŸŽ¯ **Success Metrics**
- Phase 1A: Display live ðŸ¦„ bid/ask spread âœ… **ACHIEVED**
- Phase 1B: Place and confirm real orders with rate limiting âœ… **ACHIEVED**
- Phase 1C: Detect order fill within 10 seconds âœ… **ACHIEVED**
- Phase 1D: Autonomous momentum trading bot operational âœ… **ACHIEVED**

### ðŸ”„ **Iterative Approach**
Each phase builds on previous work and can be tested independently. If any phase fails, the previous phases remain functional for debugging.
