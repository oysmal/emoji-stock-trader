# Phase 1: Core Trading Implementation - Architectural Plan

## Executive Summary

Building on the successful Phase 0 foundation, implement core trading functionality with a single stock focus (🦄) using simple, iterative development. Each component works standalone before building the next.

## Foundation Built (Phase 0 ✅)
- Modern Kotlin/Ktor infrastructure with authentication
- ApiClient with registration and portfolio access
- $20,000 starting portfolio with 6 emoji stock positions
- Gradle build system with all dependencies

---

## Phase 1A: Market Data Integration [1 day] ✅ COMPLETE

### Component: OrderBook API Integration ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Real-time market data for 🦄 stock

#### What to Build:
- Extend `ApiClient` with `getOrderBook(symbol: String)` method ✅
- Create `OrderBookResponse` data class with bid/ask levels ✅
- Add market data logging and spread calculation ✅

#### Implementation Steps:
1. Add OrderBook data models (OrderBookResponse, OrderBookLevel) ✅
2. Implement getOrderBook() method in ApiClient ✅
3. Create simple market data display in Main.kt ✅
4. Test with 🦄 symbol and log current spread ✅

#### Success Criteria:
- Display live bid/ask prices for 🦄 ✅
- Calculate and log spread (ask - bid) ✅
- Handle API errors gracefully ✅

**Dependencies**: Phase 0 ApiClient ✅  
**Effort**: 4 hours ✅ (actual: 1 day with debugging)  
**Risk**: Low - simple API extension ✅

#### ✅ **Phase 1A Results (Completed)**
- **API Integration**: Successfully connected to `/v1/orderbook` endpoint with proper query parameter format
- **Data Models**: Created `OrderBookLevel` and `OrderBookResponse` with correct JSON serialization
- **Authentication**: X-Team-Id and X-Api-Key headers working correctly
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of empty orderbooks ("No bids/asks available")
- **Testing**: Successfully tested with 🦄 symbol, handles edge cases properly
- **Code Quality**: Kotlin-code-reviewer approved with "EXCELLENT" ratings
- **User Experience**: Clean emoji-styled console output with bid/ask display

---

## Phase 1B: Rate Limiting & Order Placement [1.5 days] ✅ COMPLETE

### Component: Request Throttling ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Respect 50 req/sec API limit safely

#### What to Build:
- `RateLimiter` class with semaphore-based throttling ✅
- Buffer at 40 req/sec (20% safety margin) ✅
- Wrap all ApiClient calls with rate limiting ✅

#### Implementation Steps:
1. Create RateLimiter with semaphore + coroutine refresh timer ✅
2. Add rate limiting wrapper methods to ApiClient ✅
3. Test with rapid API calls to verify throttling ✅
4. Add logging for rate limit hits and permit tracking ✅

### Component: Order Placement API ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Place buy/sell orders for 🦄

#### What to Build:
- Extend `ApiClient` with order placement methods ✅
- Create `PlaceOrderRequest` and `OrderResponse` data models ✅
- Order placement testing in Main.kt with real orders ✅

#### Implementation Steps:
1. Add order-related data models matching OpenAPI spec ✅
2. Implement placeOrder() method with rate limiting ✅
3. Add comprehensive error handling and logging ✅
4. Test with real 🦄 limit orders (BUY at $50, SELL at $150) ✅

#### Success Criteria:
- Never exceed 40 requests/second sustained ✅
- Successfully place buy/sell orders ✅
- Handle order rejections and API errors ✅

#### ✅ **Phase 1B Results (Completed)**
- **Rate Limiting**: Semaphore-based throttling at 40 req/sec with coroutine refresh
- **Order Placement**: Successfully placed real orders (IDs: aa6422d5-39d6-46e5-bde9-4b5b15c35c3e, 11091630-0aed-40d8-ab5f-aa77de3e317a)
- **Data Models**: Fixed to match OpenAPI spec exactly (OrderResponse, OrderStatus, OrderBookLevel)
- **API Integration**: Complete with authentication, rate limiting, and error handling
- **Code Quality**: Kotlin-code-reviewer approved after fixing coroutine blocking issues
- **Testing**: Direct API testing with meaningful amounts, both buy and sell orders

**Dependencies**: Phase 1A market data ✅  
**Effort**: 12 hours ✅ (completed on schedule)  
**Risk**: Medium - rate limiting complexity ✅ (resolved)

---

## Phase 1C: Order Management & Fill Tracking [1.5 days]

### Component: Order State Management
**Goal**: Track pending orders and detect fills

#### What to Build:
- `OrderManager` class to store pending orders in memory
- Fill detection by polling `/v1/fills` endpoint
- Position tracking with buy/sell reconciliation

#### Implementation Steps:
1. Create OrderManager with in-memory order storage
2. Implement fill polling every 5 seconds
3. Add position calculation (net shares owned)
4. Create order status display

#### Success Criteria:
- Track all pending orders until filled or cancelled
- Detect fills within 10 seconds of execution
- Maintain accurate position count for 🦄

**Dependencies**: Phase 1B order placement  
**Effort**: 12 hours  
**Risk**: Medium - state management complexity

---

## Phase 1D: Simple Trading Strategy [2 days]

### Component: Momentum Trading Bot
**Goal**: Automated trading based on price movements

#### What to Build:
- `MomentumStrategy` class with 5-minute price windows
- Buy signal: Price up 2% in last 5 minutes
- Sell signal: Price down 2% in last 5 minutes
- Fixed position sizing: $1000 per trade

#### Implementation Steps:
1. Create price history tracking (last 10 data points)
2. Implement momentum calculation logic
3. Add buy/sell decision making
4. Integrate with OrderManager for execution
5. Add strategy logging and performance tracking

#### Trading Rules:
- Only trade 🦄 symbol
- Maximum 1 position at a time (buy OR sell, not both)
- $1000 fixed order size
- 5-minute decision intervals
- Stop after 10 trades or 2 hours (whichever first)

#### Success Criteria:
- Execute at least 1 profitable trade
- Never have more than 1 open order at once
- Complete full buy-sell cycle successfully
- Log all trading decisions and P&L

**Dependencies**: Phase 1C order management  
**Effort**: 16 hours  
**Risk**: High - algorithm complexity + market risk

## Implementation Schedule

| Phase | Duration | Focus | Risk Level | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|------------|---------|
| 1A    | 1 day    | Market data access | Low | ✅ **COMPLETE** |
| 1B    | 1.5 days | Rate limiting + orders | Medium | ✅ **COMPLETE** |
| 1C    | 1.5 days | Order tracking | Medium | 🔄 **NEXT** |
| 1D    | 2 days   | Trading strategy | High | ⏳ Pending |
| **Total** | **6 days** | **End-to-end trading** | **Mixed** | **2/4 Complete** |

## Key Design Decisions

### ✅ **Simplification Choices**
- **Single Stock**: Only 🦄 until everything works perfectly
- **Fixed Parameters**: $1000 orders, 5-minute intervals, no configuration
- **Memory Storage**: No database - all state in memory during runtime
- **Conservative Rate Limit**: 40 req/sec (80% of limit) for safety buffer

### 🎯 **Success Metrics**
- Phase 1A: Display live 🦄 bid/ask spread ✅ **ACHIEVED**
- Phase 1B: Place and confirm real orders with rate limiting ✅ **ACHIEVED**
- Phase 1C: Detect order fill within 10 seconds ⏳ **NEXT TARGET**
- Phase 1D: Complete profitable buy-sell cycle ⏳ Pending

### 🔄 **Iterative Approach**
Each phase builds on previous work and can be tested independently. If any phase fails, the previous phases remain functional for debugging.
